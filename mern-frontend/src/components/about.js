      <p>
        Origami is the art of paper folding with its name comeing from the
        Japanese words oru (which means 'to fold') and kami (meaning 'paper').
        Today, origami is a widely-used practice that encourages mindfulness and
        creative expression, in addtion to helping developing our hand-eye
        coordination, dexterity, and fine motor skills. And because it requires
        great mental concentration, it is also beneficial for our cognitive
        abilities too. In OrigaMe, we provide a platform for origami artists and
        crafters to share their creativity and for users to learn and
        communicate. Let's get creative!
